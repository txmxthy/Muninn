_In Norse mythology, Huginn and Muninn are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information 
to the god Odin._

## Muninn - Your All-Seeing Cybersecurity Sentinel

Muninn is an end-to-end cybersecurity tool which integrates with Metasploit and Nmap.

### What Muninn Does

Muninn scans your network for hosts, identifies them, and probes for open ports and vulnerabilities. Leveraging its 
powerful integration with Metasploit, Muninn matches detected vulnerabilities with appropriate exploits from its 
database. Users can also customize their own exploit flows, enhancing Muninn's flexibility and adaptability.

#### Key Features:
- **Network Scanning:** Discovers and identifies all hosts on the network.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Scans for open ports and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit Matching:** Automatically matches vulnerabilities to available exploits, including pre-configured flows like EternalBlue.
- **Custom Exploit Flows:** Allows users to define and implement their own frequently used exploits.
- **Privilege Escalation:** After a successful exploit, Muninn can elevate privileges to gain full administrative access.
- **Reverse Shell Access:** Provides a reverse shell for direct control over compromised systems.
- **Built-In Utilities:** Features for uploading/downloading files, taking screenshots, shutting down systems, and more.
